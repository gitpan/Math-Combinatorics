Math/Combinatorics version 0.01
===============================

NAME
    Math::Combinatorics - Perform combinations and permutations on lists

SYNOPSIS
      use Math::Combinatorics qw(combine permute);

      my @n = qw(a b c);
      print "combinations of 2 from: ".join(" ",@n)."\n";
      print "------------------------".("--" x scalar(@n))."\n";
      print join("\n", map { join " ", @$_ } combine(2,@n)),"\n";
      print "\n";
      print "permutations of 3 from: ".join(" ",@n)."\n";
      print "------------------------".("--" x scalar(@n))."\n";
      print join("\n", map { join " ", @$_ } permute(@n)),"\n";

      output:
      combinations of 2 from: a b c
      ------------------------------
      b c
      a c
      a b

      permutations of 3 from: a b c
      ------------------------------
      b a c
      b c a
      c b a
      c a b
      a c b
      a b c

DESCRIPTION

    Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics studying the enumeration,
    combination, and permutation of sets of elements and the mathematical relations
    that characterize their properties.  As a jumping off point, refer to:

    http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Combinatorics.html

    This module provides a pure-perl implementation of nCk, nPk, and n!
    (combination, permutation, and factorial, respectively).

  EXPORT

    the following export tags will bring a single method into the caller's
    namespace. no symbols are exported by default. see pod documentation
    below for method descriptions.

      combine
      permute
      factorial

BUGS
    report them to the author. a known bug (partial implementation bug) does
    not allow parameterization of k for nPk in permute(). it is assumed k ==
    n. the permute() entry elsewhere in this document for details.

SEE ALSO
    the String::Combination manpage (misnamed, it actually returns
    permutations on a string).
